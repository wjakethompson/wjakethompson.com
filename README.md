Personal website and blog (archived)
=======================

This is source code and document text for the archived version of my personal website, which was built using blogdown and Hugo.
The website is now built using Quarto.
The current version of the website can be found at [wjakethompson/wjt-quarto](https://github.com/wjakethompson/wjt-quarto).
