    Infrequently, I write about things I've been working on. If I find something
    interesting, writing a blog post is a good excuse to use it! Topics include
    data visualization, psychometrics, sports, and whatever else happens to
    pique my interest.

** No content below YAML for the blog _index. This file provides front matter for the listing page layout and sidebar content. It is also a branch bundle, and all settings under `cascade` provide front matter for all pages inside blog/. You may still override any of these by changing them in a page's front matter.**
