I'm overjoyed to announce the release of [taylor](https://taylor.wjakethompson.com) 3.0.0.
taylor provides data on Taylor Swift's discography, including lyrics from [Genius](https://genius.com/artists/Taylor-swift) and song characteristics from [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02).

You can install it from CRAN with:


```r
install.packages("taylor")
```

This blog post will highlight the major changes in this release, including the addition of data from *Speak Now (Taylor's Version)* and *1989 (Taylor's Version)*.


```r
library(taylor)
```


## Entering Our *Taylor's Version* Era

Over the past few months Taylor has released two new rerecords: *Speak Now (Taylor's Version)* and *1989 (Taylor's Version)*.
You can now find Spotify data and lyrics for both albums in [`taylor_all_songs`](https://taylor.wjakethompson.com/reference/taylor_songs.html).
There is one Target-exclusive from from *1989 (Taylor's Version)*, "Sweeter Than Fiction (Taylor's Version)," which is not yet on Spotify and therefore doesn't have audio data.
For now, only lyrics are available for this track.
Spotify audio data will be added in the future if and when it gets added to Spotify.

The color palettes have also been updated to include palette inspired by the each album cover and can be accessed in the [`album_palettes`](https://taylor.wjakethompson.com/reference/album_palettes.html) list.

<img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" alt="The five colors of the Speak Now (Taylor's Version) color palette." width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

These palettes can be used inside any of the [`scale_*_taylor()`](https://taylor.wjakethompson.com/reference/scale_taylor.html) functions.


```r
taylor_album_songs %>% 
  filter(album_name == "1989 (Taylor's Version)", !is.na(energy)) %>% 
  mutate(track_name = fct_inorder(track_name)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = energy, y = fct_rev(track_name))) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = track_name), show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_taylor_d(album = "1989 (Taylor's Version)") +
  labs(x = "Song Energy (From Spotify)", y = NULL)
```

Finally, the [package website](https://taylor.wjakethompson.com) has been updated with a new theme and logo, inspired by the *1989 (Taylor's Version)* album cover.

## The Eras Tour Data

This release also comes with a new data set, [`eras_tour_surprise`](https://taylor.wjakethompson.com/reference/eras_tour_surprise.html).
This data set includes all of the surprise that Taylor has played, including the location, the night, and the instrument that was used.


```r

We can use this data to, for example, look at how many and when songs have been played from each album.

## Minor Changes

There were also a number of minor improvements:

* Spotify data was added for "Hits Different," "Snow on the Beach (More Lana Del Rey)," and "Karma (Remix)" after they were released to streaming as part of *Midnights (The Til Dawn Edition)*.
* Additional non-album songs have been added to `taylor_all_songs`: "All of the Girls You Loved Before" from *The More Lover Chapter*, "Eyes Open (Taylor's Version)" and "Safe & Sound (Taylor's Version)" from *The More Red (Taylor's Version) Chapter*, and "If This Was a Movie (Taylor's Version)" from *The More Fearless (Taylor's Version) Chapter*.
* "This Love (Taylor's Version)" and "Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version)" have been removed from the non-album singles now that *1989 (Taylor's Version)* has been released.

See the [changelog](https://taylor.wjakethompson.com/news/index.html) for a complete list of changes.
