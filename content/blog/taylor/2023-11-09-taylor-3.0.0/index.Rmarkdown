I'm overjoyed to announce the release of [taylor](https://taylor.wjakethompson.com) 3.0.0.
taylor provides data on Taylor Swift's discography, including lyrics from [Genius](https://genius.com/artists/Taylor-swift) and song characteristics from [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02).

You can install it from CRAN with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("taylor")
```

This blog post will highlight the major changes in this release, including the addition of data from *Speak Now (Taylor's Version)* and *1989 (Taylor's Version)*.

```{r}
library(taylor)
```


## Entering Our *Taylor's Version* Era

The most important update is the addition of data from *Midnights*.
You can now find Spotify data and lyrics for all 23 songs in [`taylor_all_songs`](`r autolink_url("taylor::taylor_all_songs")`).
The Target-exclusive tracks ("Hits Different," "You're On Your Own, Kid (Strings Remix)," and "Sweet Nothing (Piano Remix)") are not yet on Spotify.
For now, only lyrics are available for these tracks.
Spotify audio data will be added if and when these tracks get added to Spotify.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

taylor_all_songs %>% 
  filter(album_name == "Midnights")
```

*Midnights* has also been added to [`taylor_albums`](`r autolink_url("taylor::taylor_albums")`).
A user score provided by Metacritic has also been added to this data.

```{r}
taylor_albums
```

Finally, a new color palette inspired by the *Midnights* album cover has been added to the [`album_palettes`](`r autolink_url("taylor::album_palettes")`), and the [package website](https://taylor.wjakethompson.com) has been updated with a new theme and logo, also inspired by the album cover.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.asp = NA}
#| fig.alt: >
#|   The five colors of the Midnights color palette. The hexadecimal codes are
#|   #121D27, #5A658B, #6F86A2, #85A7BA, and #AA9EB6

scales::show_col(unname(album_palettes$midnights))
```

This palette can be used inside any of the [`scale_*_taylor()`](https://taylor.wjakethompson.com/reference/scale_taylor.html) functions.

```{r}
#| fig.alt: >
#|   A horizontal bar graph showing track names on the y-axis and song energey
#|   on the x-axis. Bars a filled with colors derived from the Midnights color
#|   palette, ranging from navy to light blue and lavender.

taylor_album_songs %>% 
  filter(album_name == "Midnights", !is.na(energy)) %>% 
  mutate(track_name = fct_inorder(track_name)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = energy, y = fct_rev(track_name))) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = track_name), show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_taylor_d(album = "Midnights") +
  labs(x = "Song Energy (From Spotify)", y = NULL)
```


## Breaking Changes

In addition to adding *Midnights* to [`taylor_all_songs`](`r autolink_url("taylor::taylor_all_songs")`) and [`taylor_album_songs`](`r autolink_url("taylor::taylor_album_songs")`), other audio data has also been updated.
Spotify has updated the audio data for [*Red (Taylor's Version)*](https://github.com/wjakethompson/taylor/commit/4395cc107ce13afdc5ff535bd6c3d67ac8ed2567) and ["Renegade"](https://github.com/wjakethompson/taylor/commit/be95df878bb85ab5ee884ecf9d7e91ba99849e33#diff-16e84b1ed731fef624b1ef567ca9c073ddab95fc49cca127999c606c3d939918) (Taylor's feature with Big Red Machine) since the last release.
These data sets have been updated to reflect these changes accordingly.

## Minor Changes

There were also a number of minor improvements:

* Additional singles and remixes have been added to `taylor_all_songs`: "Lover (Remix)" with Shawn Mendes; "Carolina" from the *Where the Crawdads Sings* soundtrack; Ed Sheeran's "The Joker and the Queen;" Taylor's cover of Earth, Wind, and Fire's *September*; and "Three Sad Virgins" from Saturday Night Live.
* This Love (Taylor's Version) has been added as a non-ablum song. Presumably, this song will eventually move to *1989 (Taylor's Version)*.
* The album color palettes have been slightly tweaked to better capture the vibe of each album, rather than just pulling colors from the cover.

See the [changelog](https://taylor.wjakethompson.com/news/index.html) for a complete list of changes.
