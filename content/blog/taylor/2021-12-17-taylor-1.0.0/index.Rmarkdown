I'm all too excited to announce the release of [taylor](https://taylor.wjakethompson.com) 1.0.0.
taylor provides data on Taylor Swift's discography, including lyrics from [Genius](https://genius.com/artists/Taylor-swift) and song characteristics from [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/06HL4z0CvFAxyc27GXpf02).

You can install it from CRAN with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("taylor")
```

This blog post will highlight the major changes in this release, including the addition of data from *Red (Taylor's Version)* and other updates to [color palette functionality](/blog/taylor/2021-10-24-taylor-palettes/).

```{r}
library(taylor)
```


## Red (Taylor's Version)

The biggest update is the addition of data from *Red (Taylor's Version)*
You can now find Spotify data and lyrics for all 30(!!) songs in [`taylor_all_songs`](`r autolink_url("taylor::taylor_all_songs")`).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

taylor_all_songs %>% 
  filter(album_name == "Red (Taylor's Version)")
```

*Red (Taylor's Version)* has also replaced the original *Red* in [`taylor_album_songs`](`r autolink_url("taylor::taylor_album_songs")`).
So if you want only songs from Taylor's albums, you will get *Red (Taylor's Version)*, and *Fearless (Taylor's Version)*, by default, because we stan artists owning their art.

```{r echo = FALSE}
#| fig.alt: >
#|   Taylor Swift happily dancing on the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.
knitr::include_graphics("https://media.giphy.com/media/gromG2nn1K3Tg50ojX/giphy.gif")
```

```{r}
taylor_album_songs %>% 
  distinct(album_name)
```

*Red (Taylor's Version)* has also been added to [`taylor_albums`](`r autolink_url("taylor::taylor_albums")`), and has the highest Metacritic score of any of Taylor's albums.

```{r}
taylor_albums
```

Finally, a new color palette inspired by the *Red (Taylor's Version)* album cover has been added to the [`album_palettes`](`r autolink_url("taylor::album_palettes")`), and the [package website](https://taylor.wjakethompson.com) has been updated with a new theme and logo, also inspired by the album cover.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.asp = NA}
scales::show_col(unname(album_palettes$red_tv))
```

## Breaking Changes

In addition to *Red (Taylor's Version)* replacing *Red* in [`taylor_album_songs`](`r autolink_url("taylor::taylor_album_songs")`), there is one other breaking change in this release.
The `type` argument of [`color_palette()`](`r autolink_url("taylor::color_palette")`) has been deprecated in favor of an automatic interpolation.

In previous version, if we wanted to interpolate additional colors from a smaller color palette, we needed to specify `type = "continuous"`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
my_colors <- c(ku_blue = "#0051ba", "firebrick", "#ffc82d")
my_palette <- color_palette(my_colors)

# old
color_palette(my_palette, n = 10, type = "continuous")
color_palette(my_palette, n = 2, type = "discrete")
```

In the latest release, this happens automatically.
If you specify an `n` that is larger than the size of the palette (for example, `n = 10` when `my_palette` has only 3 colors), we now automatically interpolate additional colors.
Similarly, if you specify an `n` that is smaller than the number of colors in the palette, an evenly spaced sample will be taken.

## Minor Changes

There were also a number of minor improvements:

* Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version) has been added as a non-ablum song. Presumably, this song will eventually move to *1989 (Taylor's Version)*.
* [`color_palette()`](`r autolink_url("taylor::color_palette")`) now preserves color names, either through values in [`colors()`](`r autolink_url("grDevices::colors")`), or a named vector supplied to `pal`.
