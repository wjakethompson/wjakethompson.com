I am a senior psychometrician at [Accessible Teaching, Learning, and Assessment Systems](http://atlas.ku.edu/) at the University of Kansas where I work on the [Dynamic Learning Maps](http://dynamiclearningmaps.org/) alternate assessment and the [Innovations in Science Map, Assessment & Report Technologies](https://ismart.works) project. I completed my PhD in Educational Psychology & Research at the University of Kansas with an emphasis in [Research, Evaluation, Measurement, and Statistics](http://epsy.ku.edu/academics/educational-psychology-research/phd/overview-benefits). My research interests are in the areas of R programming and psychometrics, specifically the application of diagnostic classification models to educational assessment.

I love the Chiefs, Cubs, and above all else, KU basketball. I currently live in Kansas City, Kansas, with my amazing [wife](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliachasen) and our rescue dog [Larry](https://www.instagram.com/lyfewithlarry/?hl=en).
