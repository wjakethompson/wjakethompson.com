abstract: Learning map models are a type of cognitive model composed of multiple
  interconnected learning targets and other critical knowledge and skills. The
  Dynamic Learning Maps&reg; (DLM&reg;) Alternate Assessment System uses
  learning maps models as the basis for assessment for students with significant
  cognitive disabilities. The DLM maps and corresponding assessments provide
  access to multiple and alternate routes to achieving the learning targets,
  making it more inclusive for learners with various disabilities. However, the
  unique approach and design of the assessment system designed to maximize
  accessibility also poses unique psychometric challenges. In this presentation,
  we will discuss (1) the DLM assessment design; (2) the diagnostic
  classification model used to score the assessment; (3) approaches to
  empirically evaluating the map structures including future directions for data
  collection; and (4) results from research conducted on teachersâ€™
  interpretations of diagnostic assessment results.
summary: Four things to think about when creating and scoring and operational
  learning-maps based assessment.
