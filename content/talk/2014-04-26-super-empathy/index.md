abstract: One aspect of higher order social cognition is empathy, a
  psychological construct comprising a cognitive (i.e., recognizing emotions)
  and an affective (i.e., responding to emotions) component. Empathy deficits
  have been linked to executive and emotion regulation dysfunction in depression
  that might underlie a patientâ€™s interpersonal difficulties. However, most
  studies measure empathy through the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI),
  which may not accurately capture affective empathy. Critically, prior studies
  have not examined a potential dissociation between cognitive and affective
  empathy in depressed individuals. In Study 1, a factor analysis determined the
  appropriateness of using the IRI to measure affective empathy. Results showed
  poor model fit with the affective empathy factor. In Study 2, we developed a
  behavioral measure of empathy, and examined differences in empathic processing
  as it relates to depression and ruminative thought. Results revealed
  differences in empathy between depressed and healthy controls, as well as
  differences by level of rumination. We discuss the implications of these
  findings for depression treatment.
summary: A presentation on my undergraduate thesis, evaluating empathy in mood
  disorders.
