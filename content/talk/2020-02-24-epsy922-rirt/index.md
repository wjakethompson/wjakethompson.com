This workshop was delivered as guest lecture to a graduate level psychometrics course and provided an introduction to using R for Item Response Theory (IRT). Students learned how to estimate IRT model with both dichotomous and polytomous item responses using the [{mirt}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mirt/index.html) package. We also gave students the tools needed to explore and evaluate their estimated models. Along the way, we introduced several [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org) packages including [{dplyr}](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org) and [{ggplot2}](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org).
