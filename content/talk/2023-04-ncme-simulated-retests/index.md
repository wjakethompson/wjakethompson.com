Since the publication of the seminal book Diagnostic Measurement: Theory, Methods, and Applications (Rupp, Templin, Henson, 2010), there has been a wave of research on diagnostic measurement. Much of this research, however, has focused on methodological advancements and applications. But recently, there has been increased implementation of large-scale diagnostic assessments systems in K-12 settings, resulting in a need for more research on issues faced in these settings. This session, coordinated by the Diagnostic Measurement SIGMIE, presents a selection of research studies focused on issues faced in the operation of diagnostic assessments systems and their implementation. More specifically, the studies examine critical issues such as the estimation of diagnostic score reliability, validation of diagnostic results, integration of diagnostic assessment into curricula, and scoring models for diagnosing foundational skills. The session will conclude with a question and answer panel to discuss these issues in more depth.
