abstract: As the use of diagnostic assessment systems transitions from research
  applications to large-scale assessments for accountability purposes,
  reliability methods that provide evidence at each level of reporting must are
  needed. The purpose of this paper is to summarize one simulation-based method
  for estimating and reporting reliability for an operational, large-scale,
  diagnostic assessment system. This assessment system reports the results and
  associated reliability evidence at the individual skill level for each
  academic content standard and broader content strands. The system also
  summarizes results for the overall subject using achievement levels, which are
  often included in state accountability metrics. Results are summarized as
  measures of association between true and estimated mastery status for each
  level of reporting.
summary: Methods for estimating reliability for aggregated mastery
  classifications.
