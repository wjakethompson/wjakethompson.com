This five-day workshop provided an introduction to data analysis in R using the [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org) and [tidymodels](https://tidymodels.org). Participants learned how to conduct all parts of a data analysis in R, from importing data to creating a reproducible report showing the results of statistical models. We focused on giving participants the tools they need to succeed and answer questions about their data, outside of the workshop. Along the way, participants got hands-on experience using many tidyverse and tidymodels packages including [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org), [`tidyr`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org), [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org), [`parsnip`](https://parsnip.tidymodels.org), [`rsample`](https://rsample.tidymodels.org), [`recipes`](https://recipes.tidymodels.org), and [`reprex`](https://reprex.tidyverse.org).
