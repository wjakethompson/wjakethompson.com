title: Applications of Item Response Theory in R
---

This workshop provides an overview for applying Item Response Theory (IRT) models in R. This includes estimating IRT models, visualizing the estimated parameters, calculating test-level characteristics, and evaluating model fit. The IRT analyses are primarily conducted using the [`mirt`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mirt/index.html) package. Along the way, we introduce several [`tidyverse`](https://tidyverse.org) functions for transforming and visualizing data.

See the workshop websites for more, including links to the GitHub repositories for all workshop materials.
