This workshop provides an introduction to data science using R. Participants learn an entire pipeline of data analysis, from importing data to creating reproducible reports. Along the way we introduce several core [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org) packages, which work together to make the process of data analysis seemless. These include [{dplyr}](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org) for data transformation, [{tidyr}](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org) for data tidying, [{ggplot2}](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) for creating data visualizations, and [{rmarkdown}](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) for creating professional reports.

See the workshop websites for more, including links to the GitHub repositories for all workshop materials.
