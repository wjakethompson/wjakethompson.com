title: Tidy Data Science with the `tidyverse` and `tidymodels`
---

This workshop provides an introduction to data science using R. Participants learn an entire pipeline of data analysis, from importing data to creating reproducible reports. Along the way we introduce several core [`tidyverse`](https://tidyverse.org) packages, which work together to make the process of data analysis seamless. These include [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org) for data transformation, [`tidyr`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org) for data tidying, and [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) for creating data visualizations. We then introduce core [`tidymodels`](https://tidymodels.org) packages for creating modeling pipelines including, [`parsnip`](https://parsnip.tidymodels.org) for creating model specifications, [`recipes`](https://recipes.tidymodels.org) for feature engineering, and [`yardstick`](https://yardstick.tidymodels.org) for evaluating model performance. Finally, we discuss how to use [`rmarkdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) for creating reproducible reports.
