title: Thesis Formatting for the University of Kansas
---

The `jayhawkdown` package provides a template for writing theses and dissertations that meet the formatting requirements at the University of Kansas. This allows you to focus on writing, without worrying about whether or not you have met all formatting specifications. The package also allows you to build and website version of your thesis.

See the package website for an example report rendered to both a website and final PDF document.
