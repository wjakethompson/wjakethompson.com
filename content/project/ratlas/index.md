The `ratlas` package provides the infrastructure for reproducible report writing within Accessible Teaching, Learning, and Assessment Systems (ATLAS). Included are various [`rmarkdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) templates for different types of reports, custom [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) themes, and miscellaneous helper functions for formatting numbers, text, and tables. Although not useful outside of ATLAS, this package can be used as a template for creating a package for your own organization.
