  I've begun shifting my focus my theoretical research to tool building and best practices. I believe that the use of diagnostic classification models in appropriate settings could have real impact on the quality of applied research. However, these models have seen little applied use, partly because there is not sufficient guidance to support their use, and partly because currently software is difficult to use.
  
  To help facilitate the adoption of diagnostic models more widely, I now spend most of my time writing user-focused software and thinking about how best to support applied researchers in implementing diagnostic models.
