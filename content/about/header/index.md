  Hello, my name is Jake Thompson. Welcome!

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am the Assistant Director for Psychometrics at [Accessible Teaching, Learning,
and Assessment Systems (ATLAS)](https://atlas.ku.edu/) at the University of
Kansas, a part of the [Achievement and Assessment
Institute](https://aai.ku.edu/). I primarily work on the [Dynamic
Learning Maps](https://dynamiclearningmaps.org/) alternate assessment and
other grant-funded projects such as the R package [measr](https://measr.info) for estimating and evaluating diagnostic classification models. I
completed my PhD in Educational Psychology & Research at the University of
Kansas with an emphasis in Research, Evaluation, Measurement, and Statistics.
My research interests are in the areas of R programming and psychometrics,
specifically the application of diagnostic classification models to
educational assessment and applied research.

When I'm not working, I can be found with my amazing [partner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliachasen/) listening to Taylor Swift, watching true crime shows, and playing with our rescue dog, [Larry](https://www.instagram.com/lyfewithlarry/?hl=en).
