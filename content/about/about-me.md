I was born and raised in Kansas and am a proud Jayhawk. I earned both my B.Sc. in Behavioral Neuroscience and my Ph.D. in Educational Psychology at the [University of Kansas](https://www.ku.edu).
During my graduate work, I focused on educational assessment and psychometrics, following the Research, Evaluation, Measurement, and Statistics (REMS) track.
While in graduate school, I worked as a research assistant at the [Achievement and Assessment Institute](https://aai.ku.edu) (AAI).
I now work at one of the centers within AAI, [Accessible Teaching, Learning, and Assessment Systems](https://atlas.ku.edu) (ATLAS), where I am a senior psychometrician working primarily on the [Dynamic Learning Maps&reg;](https://dynamiclearningmaps.org) alternate assessment.

My [research](https://profiles.impactstory.org/u/0000-0001-7339-0300) focuses on using diagnostic classification models (DCMs) to understand how students learn, provide actionable feedback to teachers, and report meaningful measures of student achievement.
I have written numerous [publications](https://cv.wjakethompson.com/#publications) on the use of DCMs, and have presented my research at [conferences](https://cv.wjakethompson.com/#conference-presentations) across the United States and internationally.

During my time at KU and AAI, I began using the [R programming language](https://r-project.org) as a student, researcher, and instructor.
I have developed and taught [workshops](/categories/workshop/) on how to use R to explore data, answer questions, and write reports, both generally and within the area of educational assessment.

I also write R packages to increase the accessibility of R Markdown within organizations.
The [{ratlas}](https://ratlas.netlify.app) package includes R Markdown templates and custom [{ggplot2}](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) themes for writing branded reports for [ATLAS](https://atlas.ku.edu).
Similarly, the [{jayhawkdown}](https://jayhawkdown.wjakethompson.com) package provides a template for writing dissertations and theses at the University of Kansas that meeting all formatting requirements.

Thanks for reading!
