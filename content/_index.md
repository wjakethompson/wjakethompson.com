  I am a psychometrician, R developer, and dessert enthusiast. I work on projects to improve student learning and make complex psychometric models more accessible to applied researchers. I am also the author of the `measr`, `taylor`, and `ratlas` R packages, and I teach workshops on how to use R and the `tidyverse` for data analysis.
